## ZenSLAM

ZenSLAM is an experimental stereo SLAM playground. It currently provides:

* A core C++23 library (`zenslam_core`) with calibration parsing, frame abstractions, feature detection (grid + FAST/ORB/SIFT backends), stereo matching, epipolar filtering, triangulation utilities, threading helpers, and options parsing.
* An application layer (`zenslam_app`) with a simple GUI (HelloImGui + OpenCV viz) for visualizing frames, matches, and (work-in-progress) reconstructed 3D points.
* A Python utility (`zenslam_py/scripts/bag_to_images.py`) to extract image sequences from ROS1/ROS2 bag files using `rosbags` (no ROS install needed).
* A Catch2 based test target (`zenslam_tests`) for unit / regression tests.

Status: early / evolving. Expect APIs to change.

## Coding Philosophy

* Start with the most obvious solution and then refactor
* The most obvious solution will often be versbose - let this be. Once you have enough code, patterns for refactoring will suggest themselves.
* Premature abstraction (like premature optimization) is the root of all Evil.
* Aim for simplicity: make things as simple as possible, but no simpler.
* Do not overdesign. Sometimes the best solution is a simple function or a plain structure.

## Repository Layout

```
zenslam_core/     # Core C++ library sources and headers (generic SLAM components)
zenslam_app/      # GUI / application layer (ImGui + Viz3d integration)
zenslam_tests/    # Catch2 tests
zenslam_options/  # Example/options data (YAML calibration & configs)
zenslam_py/       # Python helper scripts (bag extraction)
```

---
## Dependencies

Installed via vcpkg (recommended). Core components require:

* OpenCV (modules: core, imgproc, features2d, calib3d, video, viz, contrib/nonfree if using SIFT)
* Boost (program_options)
* yaml-cpp
* spdlog
* magic_enum
* Microsoft GSL
* concurrentqueue
* hello-imgui (GUI)
* VTK (pulled indirectly by OpenCV viz)
* Catch2 (tests)

Example vcpkg install (adjust triplet, add --overlay-ports if needed):
```bash
./vcpkg install \
  boost-program-options \
  concurrentqueue \
  'hello-imgui[glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]' \
  magic-enum \
  'opencv[contrib,nonfree,vtk]' \
  spdlog \
  yaml-cpp \
  catch2
```

Ensure `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` points to your vcpkg toolchain when configuring.

---
## Configure & Build (All Targets)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/path/to/vcpkg.cmake"
cmake --build build -j
```

Run the app:
```bash
./build/zenslam_app/zenslam_app   # or from install prefix after `cmake --install build`
```

Run tests:
```bash
ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure
```

## Core Features (Implemented So Far)

* YAML stereo calibration parsing (Kalibr-style) with fundamental & projection matrix helpers.
* Feature detection via grid-based wrapper (uniform spatial distribution) over FAST/SIFT/ORB.
* Descriptor extraction + brute force matching.
* Epipolar filtering using fundamental matrix + distance threshold.
* Triangulation of filtered stereo correspondences into 3D points.
* (WIP) KLT optical flow tracking between consecutive frames.
* Utility helpers (string joins, undistortion, keypoint conversions, logging formatters for Affine3d).

## Python: Bag Image Extraction

Create venv & install:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r zenslam_py/scripts/requirements.txt
```

Usage:
```bash
python zenslam_py/scripts/bag_to_images.py <bag_path> <output_dir> \
  [--topics /cam0/image_raw /cam1/image_raw] \
  [--image-format png|jpg] [--limit-per-topic N] [--flat] [--quiet]
```

Notes:
* Supports ROS1 `.bag` and ROS2 directory bags.
* Extracts `sensor_msgs/Image` + `CompressedImage`.
* Filenames encode (relative) timestamp.

---
## Development Tips

* Enable compile commands for clangd / IDE: `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`.
* Suppress verbose VTK viz logs (optional):
  ```cpp
  #include <vtkLogger.h>
  vtkLogger::SetStderrVerbosity(vtkLogger::VERBOSITY_ERROR);
  ```
* Projection matrix built via `K * [R|t]` using minor extraction.
* Fundamental matrix: `F = K2^{-T} [t]_x R K1^{-1}` derived from relative pose.

## Roadmap (Short-Term)

* Maintain persistent keypoint tracks (KLT + descriptor refresh).
* Basic pose estimation (PnP / essential decomposition).
* Map point management (prune, merge, re-triangulate).
* Visualization of 3D points in-app (color by track length / reprojection error).
* Benchmark scripts & dataset loaders (TUM-VI, EuRoC).
